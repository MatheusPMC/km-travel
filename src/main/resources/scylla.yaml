# This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring
# The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data
# that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number
# of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.

# If you already have a cluster with one token per node, and wish to migrate to
# multiple tokens per node, see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
